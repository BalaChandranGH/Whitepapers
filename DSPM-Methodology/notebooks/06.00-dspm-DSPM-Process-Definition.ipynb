    "The roles mentioned in the “DSPM - Process Definition” and “DSPM – Stages” sections are indicative only. Depending on the size and the complexity of the projects, additional roles can be defined such as Data Architect, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Business User, Project Lead, etc. If the size of the project/organization is small or the complexity is low, then the Data Scientist may play the unicorn role with the combined roles of ML Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Architect, Data Analyst, Project Manager, Project Lead & Solution Architect. Given below are the role definitions for a small to intermediate project size/complexity.\n",
