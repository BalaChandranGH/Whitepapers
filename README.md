# Whitepapers

The repository contains the whitepapers written by me using a Jupyter notebook, for learning and reference purposes. The details of the whitepapers are given below.

### Data Science Project Management Methodology - A Guideline for Beginners
In this whitepaper, an attempt has been made to produce a hybrid project management methodology that can be used to manage and deliver data science projects of any size. Depending on the size and the complexity of the projects, some of the activities can be compromised. This whitepaper briefly talks about why DSPM is challenging, a summary of the existing PM methodologies, a guideline for beginners, different stages in a data science project, and the process definition for the proposed methodology. 

Additionally, this whitepaper lists only very few commonly used existing DSPM methodologies/ approaches. Several DSPM methodologies are being developed and published from time to time which is outside the scope of this paper. The methodology discussed in this paper is suitable for any beginner who is interested to learn/managing data science projects.

### Machine Learning Project Guidelines - For Beginners
In this whitepaper, an attempt has been made to define the processes and different stages involved in an ML project. This whitepaper can be used as a guideline (or) a reference (or) an aid to develop and deliver ML projects. The focus in this paper is mainly on the process flow, guidelines to perform tasks, and the deliverables involved in various stages of an ML project; not on the technical aspects of how to implement ML algorithms. 

This whitepaper talks about only very few commonly used ML algorithms. Several ML algorithms are already available and several others are being developed and published from time to time as well that are outside the scope of this whitepaper. 

Additionally, this whitepaper covers Supervised Learning (Regression and Classification problems) and Unsupervised Learning (Clustering problems) only. The guidelines discussed in this whitepaper are suitable for any ML enthusiast from beginner to intermediate.
