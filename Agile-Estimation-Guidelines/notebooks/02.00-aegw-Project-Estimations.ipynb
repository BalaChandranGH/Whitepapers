    "### 2.2.1. Effort estimation\n",
    "* **Understand how accurate the estimates need to be** (Accuracy >90% or a ROM with ±25% deviation)\n",
    "   - Typically, the more accurate the estimate, the more details are needed, and the more time is needed.\n",
    "   - If you are asked for a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate (say + or - 25%), you might be able to complete the work quickly, at a high level, and with a minimum amount of detail.\n",
    "    - If you must provide an accurate estimate within 10%, you might need to spend quite a bit more time and understand the work at a low level of detail.\n",
    "* **Estimate the base effort for each activity and the entire project**\n",
    "   - There are many techniques you can use to estimate the effort including expert opinion, analogy, top-down, bottom-up, parametric, etc.\n",
    "* **Add effort of specialist resources**\n",
    "   - Make sure you include efforts for part-time and specialty resources. \n",
    "   - _For eg.,_ this could include freelancers, training specialists, procurement, legal, administrative, etc.\n",
    "* **Add contingency effort**\n",
    "   - In a perfect world, all project deliverables would be correct the first time, but in real-world projects, that usually is not the case.\n",
    "   - Workplans that do not consider rework can easily end up underestimating the total effort involved.\n",
    "   - Contingency is used to reflect the uncertainty or risk associated with the estimate.\n",
    "   - If you’re asked to estimate work that is not well defined, you may add up to 50% or more to reflect the uncertainty; on the other hand, if you have done this type of project many times before, perhaps your contingency would be very small — perhaps 5%.\n",
    "* **Add project management time**\n",
    "   - In general, add 10 - 15% of the effort hours for project management.\n",
    "  - For instance, if a project estimate is 12,000 hours, a full-time project manager (1,800 hours) is needed. Or, if the project estimate is 1,000 hours, the project management time would be 150 hours.\n",
    "* **Come up with the total project effort**\n",
    "   - $Total\\ Project\\ Effort = Project\\ Base\\ Effort\\  +\\  Specialist\\ Effort\\  +\\  Contingency\\ Effort\\  +\\  PM\\ Effort$\n",
    "* **Review and adjust as necessary**\n",
    "   - Sometimes when you add up all the components, the estimate seems high or low.\n",
    "   - If your estimate doesn’t look right, go back and make adjustments to your estimating assumptions to better reflect reality.\n",
    "   - If your sponsor thinks the estimate is too high, and you don’t feel comfortable defending it, you have more work to do on the estimate; make sure it seems reasonable to you and that you are prepared to defend it."
