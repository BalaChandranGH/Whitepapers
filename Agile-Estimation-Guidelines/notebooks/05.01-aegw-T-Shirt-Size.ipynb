    "* This is a relative estimation technique, meaning first the smallest item is picked and estimated, then other items are estimated relative to this one.\n",
    "* This technique is usually used at the initial stage of a project (to estimate epics or features), however, it can be used at the late stage as well.\n",
    "* T-Shirt Size Estimation steps:\n",
    "   - **`Step 1:`** Decide the T-Shirt sizes such as XS, S, M, L, and XL, and keep the size-coded cards ready.\n",
    "   - **`Step 2:`** Map the relative sizes of each T-Shirt size (can be done along with the team members). \n",
    "      An example is given below:\n",
    "      `Epic level estimation:`\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "         (S)mall        - 1 Sprint       (or)  1 to  5 days\n",
    "         (M)edium       - 2 to 3 Sprints (or)  5 to 10 days\n",
    "         (L)arge        - 4 to 6 Sprints (or) 10 to 20 days\n",
    "         (X)tra (L)arge - 7+ Sprints (split this into smaller sizes)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      `Feature level estimation:`\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "         (X)tra (S)mall - 1 SP (or) 0.5 to  1 SP\n",
    "         (S)mall        - 2 SP (or)   1 to  2 SP\n",
    "         (M)edium       - 3 SP (or)   3 to  5 SP\n",
    "         (L)arge        - 5 SP (or)   5 to  8 SP\n",
    "         (X)tra (L)arge\t- 8 SP (or)   8 to 13 SP\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      `NOTE:` If needed, we can introduce other sizes as well (XXXS, XXS, â€¦, XXL, XXXL, etc.). However, too many sizes are not recommended to keep the process simple and quick.\n",
    "   - **`Step 3:`** Decide the team members who will be involved in the estimation process.\n",
    "   - **`Step 4:`** Decide the meeting mode (face-to-face in a room or any online tool).\n",
    "   - **`Step 5:`** Distribute the size-coded cards across the team.\n",
    "   - **`Step 6:`** The PO/BA describes an item (epic/feature) to the team, the team can ask any related queries, and the questions are answered by the PO/BA.\n",
    "   - **`Step 7:`** Each team member secretly selects a card for an estimate, which is revealed when all the cards are turned over for that particular item.\n",
    "   - **`Step 8:`** The card with the most voting is the finalized estimate for the item under discussion.\n",
    "   - **`Step 9:`** In case of uneven estimates, further discussions happen, and the next round of voting commences to come up with an estimate everyone agrees with.\n",
    "   - **`Step 10:`** Pick up the next item, go to Step 5, and repeat this process until all items are estimated.\n",
    "   - **`Step 11:`** Calculate the estimate for the project, _where m = Number of PBIs_.\n",
